Set Task: Given dice (list) and category (String), calculate the score the dice would give in a game of yacht.
Method:
* dice is sorted, and sorted_dice (list) is created to display how many dice have the same result.
* Going through the possible categories, the correct score is calculated.
Example: score([1,5,3,4,2],LITTLE_STRAIGHT) -> 30

"""
This exercise stub and the test suite contain several enumerated constants.

Since Python 2 does not have the enum module, the idiomatic way to write
enumerated constants has traditionally been a NAME assigned to an arbitrary,
but unique value. An integer is traditionally used because itâ€™s memory
efficient.
It is a common practice to export both constants and functions that work with
those constants (ex. the constants in the os, subprocess and re modules).
