Set Task: Given list_one (list) and list_two (list), determine if list_one is contained within list_two, if list_two is cointained within list_one, if both are equal or if none is true.
Method:
* An if/else check determines whether the lists are equal and if not, which list is bigger than the other.
* Using that information we loop through the bigger list and compare each slice of the size of the smaller list with the smaller list.
* If we do not find a match there the lists are unequal.
Example: sublist([1,3,5],[1,2,3,4,5]) -> "Unequal"

"""
This exercise stub and the test suite contain several enumerated constants.

Since Python 2 does not have the enum module, the idiomatic way to write
enumerated constants has traditionally been a NAME assigned to an arbitrary,
but unique value. An integer is traditionally used because itâ€™s memory
efficient.
It is a common practice to export both constants and functions that work with
those constants (ex. the constants in the os, subprocess and re modules).
